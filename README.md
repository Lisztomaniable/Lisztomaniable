- A programmer from China who is the most rookie.
- At now, My most familiar programming language is Python, I also have some knowledge of Java, C++, C……
- I’m interested in many ways. For example, classical music, chemistry, traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis, especially pulse diagnosis.
  **· Classical Music: **My favorite works by Hungarian musician Franz Liszt are the "Faust Symphony," "Sonata in B minor," and "Memories of Don Juan". So I would choose to use him as my online name, interpreting Lisztomania in my own way as my pursuit in music.
  **· Chemistry: **Although I am only in high school and have limited exposure to chemistry knowledge, it still does not affect my passion for chemistry. I hope to establish some connections between computers and chemistry in my future research on computers.
  **· Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis: **
